Re-score existing corridors using most recent available data. Evaluate new truck corridors and freight facilities as submitted by agency partners.  Throughout the process, I carefully balanced preserving the original methodology and accounting for each data source‚Äôs quirks.\nSome data used in the original study were unavailable. Working with our transportation planners, I developed a method for estimating truck volume and truck percentage of total traffic using StreetLight Data. I then carefully integrated the data sources and patched missing data to complete the project. Finally, I completed an comprehensive project wrap-up, tracking down emails, chat messages, and meeting notes to compile a definitive ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for each data source and analysis method. I used {groundhog} to preserve package versions and implemented a clever script naming convention to organize files. Documentation is a love letter to your future self - and I went all out.\nInteractive I decided to build the visualization using Tableau because I wanted to take advantage of Tableau‚Äôs dynamic tooltips, in which you can insert a mini plot. The interaction between elements, such as a map and a table, is more streamlined. Tableau can also turn out a snazzy visualization relatively quickly.\nScreenshots     Background Regional truck freight corridors were initially developed through the 2017 Regional Truck Highway Corridors Study. A technical advisory work group of public agency staff most directly engaged in highway planning guided this data-driven study that analyzed the region‚Äôs principal and minor arterials. Ultimately the study applied four data factors to establish corridor score rankings and to group the corridors into tiers 1, 2, and 3, in order of priority.\nIn 2018 the Met Council adopted the study‚Äôs final regional truck corridors into the Transportation Policy Plan and first applied the tiered corridors as project selection criteria in the Regional Solicitation process for distributing federal transportation funds. The corridors have also been used as qualifying criteria in recent funding cycles of MnDOT‚Äôs Minnesota Highway Freight Program.\n","date":1640908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656607410,"objectID":"7a1dd6db2a724e3c35708bb86ad3ea26","permalink":"https://lizroten.com/project/truck-corridor-study/","publishdate":"2021-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/truck-corridor-study/","section":"project","summary":"Making a legacy project reproducible","tags":["code optimization","From Excel to R","reproducible research","Metropolitan Council","interactive","visualization","tableau","GIS","cartography","spatial conflation","spatial operations","public data","transportation","StreetLight Data"],"title":"Regional Truck Corridor Study","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["tutorial"],"content":"I‚Äôve been obsessed with Ijeamaka Anyene‚Äôs art for months now.

Later, I re-structured the backend to follow the {golem} framework\n Regional Parks and the American Community Survey is a mini-app designed for use by Regional Parks implementing agencies to assist in their progressing toward a more equitable use of regional parks. The app complements the Regional Parks Equity Toolkit, a set of questions and a process to clarify how regional park projects are advancing equity. The app facilitates direct examination of regional parks and trails system and the demographic characteristics of the census tracts surrounding them.\n New developments After I transitioned to my split between Community Development (CD) and Metropolitan Transportation Services (MTS) divisions, another team member took the project on. I supported that person in building skills in {shiny} and {golem}. I also used GitHub to manage app enhancements and document workflow.\nNow, the app boasts a sophisticated modeling component, estimating the demographic characteristics of populations within a given distance, or buffer, around the park or trail.

I drew a gate over the park entrance and estimated the number of vehicles that pass through the gate using StreetLight Volume. Then, I applied a persons-per-vehicle multiplier to estimate the number of visitors. I also used StreetLight‚Äôs visitor home location metrics to estimate the spatial distribution of visitors.\n  Liz Roten for Metropolitan Council, 2021  Activity within the park To visualize visitor activity within the park, I generated a hexagon grid and ran StreetLight analyses for different trip intersection types.\nThese maps visualize the activity within Square Lake Park on an average day during operating hours (6am - 10pm) in Summer 2019. Each map shows a grid of hexagons covering Square Lake Park. The hexagons are colored such that darker shades indicate greater activity, and lighter shades indicate lower activity. Each trip intersection type highlights the ways in which visitors enjoy the park. However, activity on Square Lake, such as paddling, boating, or using the fishing pier, is not detected.\n View a higher resolution of this viz here   StreetLight Data Data in this data visualization comes from StreetLight Data, an independent data provider which cleans, processes and assimilates millions of spatial data points from a combination of mobile phone Location-Based Services (LBS) data and GPS data.

Since then, the state has opened additional testing locations and implemented new testing options, including no cost home testing. For the most recent information regarding COVID-19 testing in Minnesota, please see the Minnesota Department of Health website.   The COVID-19 response effort requires all hands on deck, and my team at the Metropolitan Council has been working with folks at the State of Minnesota to help answer transportation-related questions. In summer 2020, we got a request for analyzing how COVID-19 testing centers are distributed across the state so as to inform where more resources may be needed. I created a series of maps visualizing the nearest distance (by travel duration/network distance and linear distance) between random points across the state and COVID-19 testing facilities. I created maps for the entire state, as well as specific regions across the state.\nMethod I designated all federally qualified health centers in Minnesota as testing centers. Many of these health centers were already in the testing center dataset but might have slight variations in the site name or address. To keep things simple, I appended the federally qualified health centers to the testing center dataset.\nBoth distance and estimated duration were calculated using the same method. I generated a 0.5 square mile hexagon grid over the entire state and then chose a random point within each hex. I calculated the network distance and estimated travel duration from the point to the three nearest (by linear distance) testing centers. Rather than calculating distance from all 300+ testing centers, I narrowed it down to just the three nearest to reduce computing time. Of those three nearest centers, I found the shortest possible distance in miles and shortest possible travel duration in minutes and applied that to the entire hexagon.\nDistance and estimated duration were calculated using Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM), a well-established open source project which utilizes OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network data. OSM is crowd-sourced but has proven very reliable and accurate in academic studies and is used for a variety of applications across public and private sectors, including several projects at the Council. OSRM is cited as ‚ÄúCopyright ¬© Project OSRM contributors‚Äù.\nNote that this is an estimated general travel duration that does not consider congestion at different times of day, days of the week, weather conditions, roadway conditions, and other factors that affect travel time.\nMinnesota region-specific maps                ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656607410,"objectID":"001a34bbf2ac73cf0faa68046160b4ef","permalink":"https://lizroten.com/project/mdh-covid-maps/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mdh-covid-maps/","section":"project","summary":"A map series analyzing how COVID-19 testing centers are distributed across Minnesota","tags":["Metropolitan Council","health","cartography","covid","transportation","static","visualization"],"title":"Minimum distance to COVID-19 testing facilities","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Prior to 2019, regional parks use estimates were completed using a series of Excel workbooks, originally written in the 1990s.

In my house in college, filled with geography majors and map enthusiasts, we had a small print hung on the wall, and it was easy to start reading it, and end up standing there, just staring, for quite a while.\nEven viewing on a screen, its easy to see how you can get lost in the map. The colors are distinct and vivid, and the contextual information, like political boundaries and fault lines, against the aged sepia base do not distract. The map is dynamic, with irregular shapes and curves. If not done right, the messiness could overwhelm the viewer, but Fisk succeeds in capturing the audience‚Äôs attention.

The data is anonymized, aggregated, and accessed only through specific analyses.\nThis viz draws on LBS data. Cell phone apps that use LBS collect the device‚Äôs location in space and time. StreetLight detects trips, a movement with clear start and stop locations. StreetLight uses trips to create the StreetLight Traffic Index, which is a normalized measure of the relative traffic, or activity, in an area. The data‚Äôs spatial precision is 65ft or better and StreetLight estimates a 23% penetration rate for the combined US and Canada adult population.\nAnalysis For this viz, we made a hexagon grid over Como Regional Park. We then ran a StreetLight analysis to measure the relative traffic in each hexagon and repeated the analysis for Winter (November 2017 - February 2018), Summer (May 2018 - August 2018), and all 2018. StreetLight returns a Traffic Index value for each hexagon for every trip intersection type, day type, and day part configuration.\nInteractive Map In the Tableau viz, you can view the analysis results. Each hexagon on the map changes color according to its Traffic Index, or activity level. The darker the color, the higher the traffic. You can view the exact Traffic Index value of any hexagon by hovering over it. Use the map tools in the upper left corner to pan, zoom, and adjust the map view. We suggest you view this story in full screen for the best display.\n","date":1561075200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656607410,"objectID":"d2f23d1027d50272b923e9186fb28341","permalink":"https://lizroten.com/project/como-hex-streetlight-parks/","publishdate":"2019-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/como-hex-streetlight-parks/","section":"project","summary":"Visualize high activity areas within Como Regional Park and seasonal trends","tags":["Metropolitan Council","StreetLight Data","parks","Tableau","interactive","visualization"],"title":"Como Regional Park Hex Grid StreetLight Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":["Liz Roten"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559952000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656607410,"objectID":"1ced15f14dc52b9b09b05d1880fe908d","permalink":"https://lizroten.com/talk/tcrg-streetlight-parks/","publishdate":"2019-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/tcrg-streetlight-parks/","section":"talk","summary":"StreetLight Data provides aggregated cell phone location data for transportation research.
