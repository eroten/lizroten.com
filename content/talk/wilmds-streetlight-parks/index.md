# summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "It’s one thing to know that transportation is a significant cause of greenhouse gas emissions — it’s another to quantify how much. To address the scarcity of transportation emissions data in Minnesota, the Metropolitan Council of the Twin Cities has developed greenhouse gas emission estimates for transportation and land for cities, townships, and counties of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Region. This session will demonstrate how to leverage big data to centralize this type of research, save public funding, and enable communities to focus their efforts on implementing strategies to become more sustainable."
