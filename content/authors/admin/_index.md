I am a highly motivated data scientist and cartographer with a passion for data visualization. I make complex topics easy to understand using compelling visual design. My static and interactive visualizations are attractive and powerful tools for decision making.  

Behind the plots and maps, I’ve successfully built R packages for processing gigabytes of information quickly, managing consistent visual identity across products, and standardizing data cleaning practices.
