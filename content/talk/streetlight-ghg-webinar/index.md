summary: 'Measure Greenhouse Gases and Reduce Emissions'
abstract: "New federal requirements announced by the FHWA will put pressure on agencies to measure greenhouse gases (GHG) from transportation and track reductions. StreetLight has already been widely used to help agencies reduce transportation emissions through strategies like mode shift, electrification, and GHG measurement. Now, to help public agencies and consulting firms meet climate goals faster, StreetLight has launched a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions product.Join our webinar on Thursday, December 14 2PM Eastern / 11AM Pacific as we discuss how data supports the most critical emissions reduction strategies, how the right GHG calculations produces more actionable emissions insights, a deep dive on our new GHG emissions measurement product, and how Metropolitan Council, the Twin Cities’ MPO, use our data for emissions work"

New federal requirements announced by the FHWA will put pressure on agencies to measure greenhouse gases (GHG) from transportation and track reductions. StreetLight has already been widely used to help agencies reduce transportation emissions through strategies like mode shift, electrification, and GHG measurement.

Now, to help public agencies and consulting firms meet climate goals faster, StreetLight has launched a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions product.

Join our webinar on Thursday, December 14 2PM Eastern / 11AM Pacific as we discuss:

- How data supports the most critical emissions reduction strategies
- How the right GHG calculations produces more actionable emissions insights
- A deep dive on our new GHG emissions measurement product
- How Metropolitan Council, the Twin Cities’ MPO, use our data for emissions work
