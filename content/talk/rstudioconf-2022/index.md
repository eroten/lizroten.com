summary: Find delight in the mundane
abstract: 'It happens to us all - a request to "just re-run the code" turns into a project nightmare. The materials left to you are poorly documented and scattered across Word, Excel, ArcGIS, and PDF reports. In this talk, I show you how to turn any project into a point of pride. Using a worked example, I provide guidance on how to complete a project intake, find your opportunity to shine, and how to work efficiently and reproducibly through thoughtful documentation. Finally, I cover how to set up the project for future success. Learn how to take the messy project you dread and make it inexplicably satisfying.'
