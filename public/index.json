Later, I re-structured the backend to follow the {golem} framework\n Regional Parks and the American Community Survey is a mini-app designed for use by Regional Parks implementing agencies to assist in their progressing toward a more equitable use of regional parks. The app complements the Regional Parks Equity Toolkit, a set of questions and a process to clarify how regional park projects are advancing equity. The app facilitates direct examination of regional parks and trails system and the demographic characteristics of the census tracts surrounding them.\n New developments After I transitioned to my split between Community Development (CD) and Metropolitan Transportation Services (MTS) divisions, another team member took the project on. I supported that person in building skills in {shiny} and {golem}. I also used GitHub to manage app enhancements and document workflow.\nNow, the app boasts a sophisticated modeling component, estimating the demographic characteristics of populations within a given distance, or buffer, around the park or trail.

Since then, the state has opened additional testing locations and implemented new testing options, including no cost home testing. For the most recent information regarding COVID-19 testing in Minnesota, please see the Minnesota Department of Health website.\r\r\rThe COVID-19 response effort requires all hands on deck, and my team at the Metropolitan Council has been working with folks at the State of Minnesota to help answer transportation-related questions. In summer 2020, we got a request for analyzing how COVID-19 testing centers are distributed across the state so as to inform where more resources may be needed. I created a series of maps visualizing the nearest distance (by travel duration/network distance and linear distance) between random points across the state and COVID-19 testing facilities. I created maps for the entire state, as well as specific regions across the state.\nMethod I designated all federally qualified health centers in Minnesota as testing centers. Many of these health centers were already in the testing center dataset but might have slight variations in the site name or address. To keep things simple, I appended the federally qualified health centers to the testing center dataset.\nBoth distance and estimated duration were calculated using the same method. I generated a 0.5 square mile hexagon grid over the entire state and then chose a random point within each hex. I calculated the network distance and estimated travel duration from the point to the three nearest (by linear distance) testing centers. Rather than calculating distance from all 300+ testing centers, I narrowed it down to just the three nearest to reduce computing time. Of those three nearest centers, I found the shortest possible distance in miles and shortest possible travel duration in minutes and applied that to the entire hexagon.\nDistance and estimated duration were calculated using Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM), a well-established open source project which utilizes OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network data. OSM is crowd-sourced but has proven very reliable and accurate in academic studies and is used for a variety of applications across public and private sectors, including several projects at the Council. OSRM is cited as “Copyright © Project OSRM contributors”.\nNote that this is an estimated general travel duration that does not consider congestion at different times of day, days of the week, weather conditions, roadway conditions, and other factors that affect travel time.\nMinnesota region-specific maps \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r ","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612545795,"objectID":"001a34bbf2ac73cf0faa68046160b4ef","permalink":"lizroten.com/project/mdh-covid-maps/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"lizroten.com/project/mdh-covid-maps/","section":"project","summary":"A map series analyzing how COVID-19 testing centers are distributed across Minnesota","tags":["Metropolitan Council","health","cartography","covid","transportation","static","visualization"],"title":"Minimum distance to COVID-19 testing facilities","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"You can see the published reports here\nBackground ","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612545124,"objectID":"fe4c0112d10bc18d9f446fab9f789aeb","permalink":"lizroten.com/project/regional-parks-use-estimates/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"lizroten.com/project/regional-parks-use-estimates/","section":"project","summary":"A set of reusable tools for calculating and visualizing annual regional parks use estimates","tags":["Metropolitan Council","packages","github","pkgdown","parks"],"title":"{use.estimates}","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In early 2020, the transportation and modeling team at the Metropolitan Council began using traffic data from the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) to evaluate the impact of recent physical distancing efforts on regional and statewide travel.

The data is anonymized, aggregated, and accessed only through specific analyses.\nThis viz draws on LBS data. Cell phone apps that use LBS collect the device\u0026rsquo;s location in space and time. StreetLight detects trips, a movement with clear start and stop locations. StreetLight uses trips to create the StreetLight Traffic Index, which is a normalized measure of the relative traffic, or activity, in an area. The data’s spatial precision is 65ft or better and StreetLight estimates a 23% penetration rate for the combined US and Canada adult population.\nAnalysis For this viz, we made a hexagon grid over Como Regional Park. We then ran a StreetLight analysis to measure the relative traffic in each hexagon and repeated the analysis for Winter (November 2017 - February 2018), Summer (May 2018 - August 2018), and all 2018. StreetLight returns a Traffic Index value for each hexagon for every trip intersection type, day type, and day part configuration.\nInteractive Map In the Tableau viz, you can view the analysis results. Each hexagon on the map changes color according to its Traffic Index, or activity level. The darker the color, the higher the traffic.
